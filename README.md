# Foot Cuff Control App

This Android application is designed to control a foot cuff used to prevent edema. The app communicates with a **Seeed XIAO ESP32-C6 microcontroller** via BLE to manage the inflation and deflation of the cuff based on strain readings. It features an emergency stop functionality, manual control buttons, a progress bar to visualize the cuff's inflation/deflation state, and BLE connectivity for controlling the microcontroller. It was created for an Imperial College London module project. The NordicSemiconductor Kotlin BLE Library has been used as a wrapped around the native API as BLE in Android is a pain.

## Features

- **Emergency Stop**: Instantly stops the inflation/deflation process and deflates the cuff to baseline (no inflation) when needed.
- **Manual Inflate/Deflate Buttons**: Allows the user to override the automatic inflation/deflation process with manual control for inflating or deflating the cuff as necessary.
- **Inflation/Deflation Control**: The app allows the user to inflate or deflate the foot cuff based on the strain reading to maintain optimal comfort and prevent swelling.
- **Progress Bar (1-10)**: The app displays a progress bar from 1 to 10 to show the current inflation/deflation state of the cuff. The color of the bar changes as the cuff inflates or deflates, providing a visual representation of the status.
- **BLE Connectivity**: The app connects to a **Seeed XIAO ESP32-C6 microcontroller** over BLE to control the inflation and deflation of the cuff in real-time, adjusting the pressure based on strain readings.
- **Cuff Pressure Monitoring**: The app monitors the foot cuffâ€™s pressure, ensuring that it inflates when the foot starts swelling and deflates when pressure decreases.

## How It Works

1. **BLE Connection**:
    - The app will show the status of the BLE connection.
    - Once connected, it communicates with the **Seeed XIAO ESP32-C6 microcontroller** to send commands for inflating or deflating the cuff.

2. **Inflation/Deflation Process**:
    - The app displays a progress bar ranging from 1 (fully deflated) to 10 (fully inflated).
    - As the cuff inflates or deflates, the progress bar's color will change, providing a visual indicator.
    - The cuff pressure is automatically adjusted based on the strain reading, inflating or deflating as necessary to maintain optimal pressure.

3. **Emergency Stop**:
    - If immediate action is needed, press the **Emergency Stop** button. This will halt the inflation/deflation process and deflate the cuff to baseline (no inflation).

4. **Manual Inflate/Deflate Buttons**:
    - The app includes manual control buttons to override the automatic inflation/deflation process, allowing the user to manually inflate or deflate the cuff as necessary.
